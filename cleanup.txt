❯ I'd like to start getting this project ready to share with others. Can    
  you review the project and determine what, if anything, needs to be       
  cleaned up, fixed, changed, etc., to get the project ready to share with  
  others? (By the way, by "others", I mean consumers or users of the        
  command line API or VSCode extension. The GuidedTrack engineering team is 
   very small and has its own workload, so I don't expect them to make      
  updates to this library via pull requests or otherwise.)

  Release Readiness Review

  Overall the project is in very good shape. Clean code, 785 passing tests, good
   documentation, proper licensing. Here's what I'd address before sharing:

  Bugs to Fix

  1. Hardcoded version in CLI — src/cli.ts:50 has console.log('gtlint v0.1.0')
  but package.json says 0.11.0. This should read the version from package.json
  dynamically (or at least be updated to match).

  Files to Remove

  2. Temp sample files — 7 scratch files are committed and should be deleted:
    - samples/temp1.gt through samples/temp5.gt
    - samples/temp-child.gt, samples/temp-parent.gt
  3. examples/unreachable-code-examples.gt — This looks like a development test
  file, not user-facing documentation. Consider removing it (or moving it into
  samples/ if it's a useful demonstration).

  Documentation Cleanup

  4. readme.md → README.md — Lowercase filename works but uppercase is
  conventional and expected.
  5. README intro grammar — Line 3 says "GTLint is linter" — missing the article
   "a" ("is a linter").
  6. README CLI name inconsistency — The README shows npx gt-lint but the npm
  package is @jrc03c/gt-lint and the binary is gtlint. After scoped install, the
   actual command would be npx gtlint, not npx gt-lint. Worth verifying and
  correcting.
  7. VSCode extension install instructions — Currently requires cloning the repo
   and building from source. If you plan to publish to the VS Code Marketplace,
  that section would change. If not, the instructions are fine but could note
  that users need pnpm installed.
  8. gt.pdf references — CLAUDE.md and LANGUAGE_SPEC.md reference /gt.pdf but
  the file isn't in the repo (and shouldn't be). This is fine for your local
  workflow but may confuse someone reading CLAUDE.md. Not a big deal since
  CLAUDE.md is developer-facing.

  Git/Repo Hygiene

  9. .gitignore has personal dotfiles — Entries like .bash_profile, .bashrc,
  .zshrc, .gitconfig, .ripgreprc, .profile, .zprofile are your local machine
  artifacts. This is harmless but a bit unusual. A cleaner approach would be to
  put these in a global gitignore (~/.gitignore_global) rather than the
  project's .gitignore.
  10. .gitignore has bare git directory names — HEAD, hooks, objects, refs,
  config are listed, which look like they were added to ignore a nested .git
  directory's contents leaking. These are unusual entries for a project
  gitignore.
  11. Git submodule points to private repo — .gitmodules references
  git@github.com:GuidedTrack/guidedtrack-lib via SSH. Public consumers won't be
  able to clone with --recurse-submodules unless that repo is also public. The
  submodule is only used for integration tests, so this is fine functionally,
  but you should document this (e.g., "submodule tests require access to the
  private GuidedTrack lib repo and can be skipped").
  12. .claude/ directory — settings.json is empty and settings.local.json is
  gitignored. The committed empty settings.json and empty subdirectories
  (agents/, commands/, skills/) are harmless but add clutter. Up to you whether
  to keep or remove.

  Nice-to-Haves (Not Blocking)

  13. No CONTRIBUTING.md — Since you don't expect outside contributions, this is
   fine. But a brief note in the README saying "Issues welcome, PRs not
  expected" (or similar) would set expectations.
  14. GitHub Actions workflows — The claude.yml and claude-code-review.yml
  workflows are fine to keep. They reference secrets that only work in your
  repo, so they're harmless for others to see.
  15. npm publish readiness — The files field in package.json correctly limits
  the published package to bin/ and dist/. The package is already published up
  to 0.5.2, so 0.11.0 will be the next publish. Make sure to run pnpm run build
  before publishing since dist/ is gitignored.
